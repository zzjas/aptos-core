# MoveSmith

A Move source code level fuzzer.

# Usage

Make sure you have all the necessary [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Fuzzing

To start fuzzing, run
```bash
cargo fuzz run <fuzz_target>
```

Currently we have two fuzz targets in `fuzz/fuzz_targets`:

* `compile_v1_only`: compiles the generated Move programs using compiler V1
* `transactional`: run the generated Move programs as transactional tests so that we can cover compiler V1, V2, and the VM


If some unwanted crash stopped the fuzzer and you want to ignore it, use:
```bash
cargo fuzz run <fuzz_target> -- -fork=1 -ignore_crashes=1
```

All crash triggering inputs are stored in `fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>`.  However, the inputs are raw bytes. To convert raw bytes to Move, you can use:
```bash
cargo run --bin raw2move < fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>/<input_file>
```

## Static generator

Instead of directly running the fuzzing session, you can also use the static generator with a fixed seed to generate a number of Move files/packages. This could be helpful to debug the fuzzer or to use the generated files for other purposes.

The generator can be used by `cargo run --bin generator -- <Options>` and available options are:

```
Options:
  -o, --output-dir <OUTPUT_DIR>  The output directory to store the generated Move files
  -s, --seed <SEED>              An optional number as seed, the default should be 0 [default: 0]
  -n, --num-files <NUM_FILES>    An optional number as the number of files to generate, the default should be 100 [default: 100]
  -p, --package                  A boolean flag to create a package, default to false
```
## Coverage

After running a fuzzing session, the coverage of all stored corpus can be generated by:
```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh gen <fuzz_target>
```

This will create an HTML report at `coverage/<fuzz_target>/index.html`.

## Debugging

## Compilation

The script `./scripts/check_output.sh` is a helper for checking the generated programs.
By default it generates 10 Move packages stored in `output/`, compiles them with compiler V1, and reports any error encountered.
Use `./scripts/check_output.sh N` to generate `N` packages instead.

## Transactional test

To execute the generated Move programs as transactional tests, use the script:
```
./scripts/transactional-test.sh N
```

This script will generate `N` programs under `third_party/move/move-compiler-v2/transactional-tests/tests/move-smith`.
It will than apply a patch to the test harness to only run with the newly generated files.

# Dependencies

## cargo-fuzz

[cargo-fuzz][cargo-fuzz] provides many handy commands for running fuzzing. Install with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Nightly Toolchain

The nightly rust toolchain is required for instrumenting the code. Install with:
```bash
rustup install nightly
```

To overwrite the top-level `rust-toolchain.toml`, use:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

## [Optional] Coverage

To generate human-readable coverage reports, we need `llvm` coverage tools.
They can be installed with:
```bash
rustup component add --toolchain nightly llvm-tools-preview
```
