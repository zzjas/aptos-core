# MoveSmith

A Move source code level fuzzer.

# Usage

Make sure you have all the necessary [dependencies](#dependencies).

## Fuzzing

To start fuzzing, run
```bash
cargo fuzz run <fuzz_target>
```

All fuzz targets live in `fuzz/fuzz_targets`.

If some unwanted crash stopped the fuzzer and you want to ignore it, use:
```bash
cargo fuzz run <fuzz_target> -- -fork=1 -ignore_crashes=1
```

All crash triggering inputs are stored in `fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>`.  However, the inputs are raw bytes. To convert raw bytes to Move, you can use:
```bash
cargo run raw2move < fuzz/artifacts/<fuzz_target>/<input_file>
```

## Coverage

After running a fuzzing session, the coverage of all stored corpus can be generated by:
```bash
./scripts/coverage.sh gen <fuzz_target>
```

This will create an HTML report at `coverage/<fuzz_target>/index.html`.

# Dependencies

## cargo-fuzz

[cargo-fuzz][cargo-fuzz] provides many handy commands for running fuzzing. Install with:
```bash
cargo install cargo-fuzz
```

## Nightly Toolchain

The nightly rust toolchain is required for instrumenting the code. Install with:
```bash
rustup install nightly
```

To overwrite the top-level `rust-toolchain.toml`, use:
```bash
rustup override set nightly
```

## [Optional] Coverage

To generate human-readable coverage reports, we need `llvm` coverage tools.
They can be installed with:
```bash
rustup component add --toolchain nightly llvm-tools-preview
```
