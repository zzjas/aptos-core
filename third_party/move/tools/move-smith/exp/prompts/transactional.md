Here is an example of what a transactional test look in in Move.

```move
//# publish
module 0xc0ffee::m {
    fun and(x: bool, y: bool): bool {
        x && y
    }

    public fun test(): bool {
        let x = 1;
        and({x = x - 1; x == 0}, {x = x + 3; x == 3}) && {x = x * 2; x == 6}
    }
}

//# run 0xc0ffee::m::test

//# run 0xc0ffee::m::test
```

This piece of code is a transactional test.
It first creates and publish a module. This module has a function `and` and a function `test`.
Then the code uses `//# run ADDRESS::MODULE::FUNCTION` to execute the function `test`.
Note that for a transactional test, the address can be an arbitrary hex number.
Also note that, multiple `//# run`s have to be separated by new lines.

Remember, you are writing the Aptos version of Move.

Please generate a Move transactional test for the __REPLACE_0__ feature.
Please focus on covering all edge cases for __REPLACE_0__.
Your goal is to write an extensive test suite to discover potential bugs in the Move compiler or VM.

You should only reply with the code without any other natural language.
